<h3>Origins of this Project.</h3>
<p>I've always wanted to code my own website, in my own style. I felt this would be an excellent learning experience for me as I can get familiar with the web hosting process and refresh my html/css skills. I wanted to create a website that felt very true to me and my style. I didnt feel the need to create an overly fancy website full of javascript because I wanted a simple website that felt like something from the old internet. I wanted this website to be something that I can always keep updated with anything I work on.</p>

<h3>The Development Process</h3>
<p>I started by picking a color scheme and font, then dove right into development. It took a lot of trial and error to get the ASCII Art right and to build the social media links on the top of the page. </p>

<p>Anyways, as I moved through the website, more and more formatting challenges arose. I taught myself more and more and really bagan to enjoy the project and the process. Overall this is a project that I am proud of myself for accomplishing, even if it is a seemingly basic website.</p>

<h3>Future Plans with the Site</h3>
<p>This repository will be conintually updated as I also update my website. I am currently planning to have a seperate sub-page for each project I put on the website. I am also planning on having other sub-pages where I show off my friends art, and a sub-page where I simply blog about my cybersecurity journey.</p>
