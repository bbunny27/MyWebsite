<h3>Origins of this Project.</h3>
<p>I've always wanted to code my own website, in my own style. I felt this would be an excellent learning experience for me as I can get familiar with the web hosting process and refresh my html/css skills. I wanted to create a website that felt very true to me and my style. I didnt feel the need to create an overly fancy website full of javascript because I wanted a simple website that felt like something from the old internet. I wanted this website to be something that I can always keep updated with anything I work on.</p>

<h3>The Development Process</h3>
<p>I started by picking a color scheme and font, then dove right into development. It took a lot of trial and error to get the ASCII Art right and to build the social media links on the top of the page. </p>
