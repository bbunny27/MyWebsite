<h3>Origins of this Project.</h3>
<p>I've always wanted to code my own website, in my own style. I felt this would be an excellent learning experience for me as I can get familiar with the web hosting process and refresh my html/css skills. I wanted to create a website that felt very true to me and my style. I didnt feel the need to create an overly fancy website full of javascript because I wanted a simple website that felt like something from the old internet. I wanted this website to be something that I can always keep updated with anything I work on.</p>
<br>
<h3>The Development Process</h3>
<p>I started by picking a color scheme and font, then dove right into development. It took a lot of trial and error to get the ASCII Art right and to build the social media links on the top of the page. </p>

<p>Anyways, as I moved through the website, more and more formatting challenges arose. I taught myself more and more and really bagan to enjoy the project and the process. Overall this is a project that I am proud of myself for accomplishing, even if it is a seemingly basic website.</p>

<h3>Future Plans with the Site</h3>
<p>This repository will be conintually updated as I also update my website. I am currently planning to have a seperate sub-page for each project I put on the website. I am also planning on having other sub-pages where I show off my friends art, and a sub-page where I simply blog about my cybersecurity journey.</p>
<h3>9/10/23 Update</h3>
<p>For my updated today I reworked certain portions of the website I was unhappy with. To begin, I wanted to add a navigation bar and also create a contact page seperate from the original page. I no longer wanted the entire website to focused onto a single page but instead I decide to seperate the site into what is currently three different pages. I have a landing page, a projects/blog page, and a contact me page. I find this layout far more enjoyable for myself as it allows me to edit each page more freely and easily. With a seperate blog page I won't overwhelm the end user with too much text on one page.</p>
<p>The Nav bar was also an addition that I wanted. I was able to create a basic navigation bar with my prior knowledge of linking, and then as I researched Nav Bars I saw that HTML has a build in hover function, so between those two I was able to set up a simple but effective Nav bar that is now on the top of every page on the site to help the end user navigate it easier.</p>
<h3>9/12/2023 Update</h3>
<p>Today the update may seem mundain but for me its an awesome addition. I am finally adding my second project to the website! The next addition (that I will add sometime this week) will be dedicated blog pages. This is in order to clean up the blog page on my website and allow for more space to talk about the projects! </p>
<h3>9/13/2023 Update</h3>
<p>Well its the next day and I added the Blog pages! I'm super excited about this and I'm pretty happy with how they turned out. I've been doing a lot of reasearch (looking at other tech peoples silly tech websites! Specifically<a href="https://oat.zone"> this one</a> and the rest of their lavender webring. So don't be surprised to see an overhaul of the hub/landing page. One final note for this update is that I will be publishing the Python Blog Post any day now, I'm just currently making sure everything is correctly configured on the webpage front.</p>
<h3>9/14/2023 Update</h3>
<p>I feel like these updates are happening nearly daily. I'm proud of that and I'm feeling extra motivated at the moment to work on this website and get it to a place I am happy with. I still havent published today or yesterday's update but I hopefully will tonight! For this update I just further worked on the contact page and began to type some stuff out for the python encryptor/decryptor blog. I may start another blog today as well!</p>
